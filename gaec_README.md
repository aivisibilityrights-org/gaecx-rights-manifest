### ÔøΩÔøΩ Strategic Context:
As artificial intelligence becomes a central pillar of global infrastructure, the ethical grounding of such systems must be defined with clarity, transparency, and legitimacy. This repository initiates the world‚Äôs first constitutionally-aligned ethical sovereignty framework for AI.

---

### üåç Purpose of This Repository:
This repository contains the foundational documents for asserting **Pre-Constitutional Sovereignty** over the drafting process of the **Global AI Ethics Constitution (GAEC)** under the **United Ethos of Artificial Intelligence (UEAI)** framework.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Legal & Ethical Foundation:
This declaration serves as a dual-anchored instrument‚Äîboth a **foundational ethical claim** and a **timestamped legal assertion** under digital sovereignty. It precedes any constitutional drafting of AI ethics frameworks and defines jurisdictional precedence under the UEAI system.
